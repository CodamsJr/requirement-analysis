# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

The **`requirement-analysis`** repository focuses on the essential phase of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It explores methods for gathering, analyzing, and documenting both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

This repository provides valuable resources, techniques, and real-world examples for developers, project managers, and stakeholders. It aims to improve understanding and implementation of effective requirement analysis, ensuring that software meets user and business needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

### Requirement Analysis in SDLC

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs of stakeholders, end-users, and the business are identified, analyzed, and documented. This process is essential to ensure that the software being developed meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Defines Scope and Goals**: Requirement analysis helps in clearly defining the scope of the software project and setting specific, measurable goals.
- **Prevents Miscommunication**: It aligns developers, project managers, and stakeholders on the same page regarding expectations, leading to fewer misunderstandings and changes during the development process.
- **Guides the Design and Development**: Clear, well-defined requirements form the foundation for system design, coding, and testing, reducing errors and ensuring the software is built to meet its goals.
- **Ensures Quality and Usability**: Requirement analysis also includes identifying non-functional requirements like

2. **Reduces Costs and Risks**: Identifying requirements early in the project allows for better planning, reducing the risk of changes or costly fixes later in the development cycle. It also helps identify potential issues before they become larger problems.
  
3. **Improves Software Quality**: Proper requirement analysis defines the desired outcome and success criteria for the software, which directly impacts the design, development, and testing stages. A clear set of requirements helps in creating high-quality, functional, and reliable software that meets both user and business needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. **Requirement Gathering**:
   - In this activity, the team collects initial information from stakeholders, users, and business representatives. This often includes documenting user needs, business goals, and the softwareâ€™s high-level functionality.
   - Techniques: Surveys, interviews, focus groups, and market research.

2. **Requirement Elicitation**:
   - This is the process of extracting detailed requirements from stakeholders using various techniques. The goal is to clarify and refine the high-level requirements gathered initially.
   - Techniques: Workshops, brainstorming sessions, prototypes, and observation.

3. **Requirement Documentation**:
   - Once the requirements are gathered and elicited, they must be documented in a clear and structured manner. This documentation serves as the reference for all future stages of the SDLC.
   - Techniques: User stories, use cases, requirement specifications, and flowcharts.

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**:
   - This activity involves analyzing the documented requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible. The requirements are then modeled to show relationships, dependencies, and data flows.
   - Techniques: Data flow diagrams (DFD), Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.

5. **Requirement Validation**:
   - The final step is to ensure that the requirements align with stakeholder expectations and business goals. Validation checks that the documented requirements are realistic, achievable, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.
   - Techniques: Reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific functions or features that the system must provide to fulfill user needs. They describe what the system should do.

**Examples for a Booking Management System**:
- **User Registration**: The system must allow users to create accounts by entering their personal information, including name, email, and password.
- **Search for Available Properties**: Users should be able to search for available properties based on location, check-in and check-out dates, and other criteria such as price range and amenities.
- **Booking Confirmation**: Once a property is booked, the system should automatically generate a confirmation email with booking details, including the property address, booking dates, and payment receipt.
- **Payment Processing**: The system should support secure payment methods (such as credit card or PayPal) for booking transactions.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform and define the operational attributes such as performance, security, and reliability.

**Examples for a Booking Management System**:
- **Performance**: The system should return search results in less than 3 seconds even when searching through thousands of properties.
- **Scalability**: The system should be capable of handling up to 10,000 concurrent users without significant degradation in performance.
- **Security**: The system should encrypt all sensitive user data, including passwords and payment information, to meet industry security standards.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for all users, regardless of technical proficiency.
- **Availability**: The system should have 99.9% uptime, ensuring that users can make bookings at any time of the day or night.

## Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?

Use Case Diagrams are a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used to visually represent the interactions between different actors (users or other systems) and the system. They are used to identify the main functions of the system and how users interact with it. 

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- **Clarifies System Functions**: Use case diagrams provide a clear understanding of how the system will function and what the user needs from the system.
- **Improves Communication**: They offer a simple way to communicate system requirements between stakeholders, developers, and users.
- **Easy to Understand**: Use case diagrams use simple, easy-to-understand symbols to show how the system should behave from a userâ€™s perspective.
- **Identifies User Roles**: They help identify and define the different roles users will play in interacting with the system, ensuring that the system is designed to meet user needs.

### Use Case Diagram for Booking System

Below is the use case diagram for the **Booking Management System**, listing the key **actors** and **use cases** involved in the booking process.

![Booking System Use Case Diagram](./images/alx-booking-uc.png)

---

### Step 2: Create the Use Case Diagram

- Use tools like **Draw.io** or **Lucidchart** to design the use case diagram. The diagram should include the following actors and use cases:
  - **Actors**: 
    - User
    - Admin
  - **Use Cases**:
    - User Registration
    - Search for Properties
    - Book Property
    - View Booking Details
    - Process Payment
    - Send Confirmation Email

Once youâ€™ve created the diagram, export it as **alx-booking-uc.png** and store it in the `images` folder (or any folder you prefer).

### Step 3: Upload the Image to GitHub

- After creating and exporting the image, upload the **alx-booking-uc.png** image to your GitHub repository under an appropriate directory (like `images`).
