# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

The **`requirement-analysis`** repository focuses on the essential phase of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It explores methods for gathering, analyzing, and documenting both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

This repository provides valuable resources, techniques, and real-world examples for developers, project managers, and stakeholders. It aims to improve understanding and implementation of effective requirement analysis, ensuring that software meets user and business needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

### Requirement Analysis in SDLC

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs of stakeholders, end-users, and the business are identified, analyzed, and documented. This process is essential to ensure that the software being developed meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Defines Scope and Goals**: Requirement analysis helps in clearly defining the scope of the software project and setting specific, measurable goals.
- **Prevents Miscommunication**: It aligns developers, project managers, and stakeholders on the same page regarding expectations, leading to fewer misunderstandings and changes during the development process.
- **Guides the Design and Development**: Clear, well-defined requirements form the foundation for system design, coding, and testing, reducing errors and ensuring the software is built to meet its goals.
- **Ensures Quality and Usability**: Requirement analysis also includes identifying non-functional requirements like
