# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

The **`requirement-analysis`** repository focuses on the essential phase of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It explores methods for gathering, analyzing, and documenting both **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

This repository provides valuable resources, techniques, and real-world examples for developers, project managers, and stakeholders. It aims to improve understanding and implementation of effective requirement analysis, ensuring that software meets user and business needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

### Requirement Analysis in SDLC

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs of stakeholders, end-users, and the business are identified, analyzed, and documented. This process is essential to ensure that the software being developed meets both functional and non-functional requirements.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Defines Scope and Goals**: Requirement analysis helps in clearly defining the scope of the software project and setting specific, measurable goals.
- **Prevents Miscommunication**: It aligns developers, project managers, and stakeholders on the same page regarding expectations, leading to fewer misunderstandings and changes during the development process.
- **Guides the Design and Development**: Clear, well-defined requirements form the foundation for system design, coding, and testing, reducing errors and ensuring the software is built to meet its goals.
- **Ensures Quality and Usability**: Requirement analysis also includes identifying non-functional requirements like

- **Guides the Design and Development**: Clear, well-defined requirements form the foundation for system design, coding, and testing, reducing errors and ensuring the software is built to meet its goals.
- **Ensures Quality and Usability**: Requirement analysis also includes identifying non-functional requirements like performance, security, and scalability, ensuring the system is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.
- **Minimizes Risks**: By understanding user needs upfront, requirement analysis helps identify potential risks early, allowing teams to mitigate or avoid issues later in the development cycle.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Clarifies Stakeholder Expectations**: Requirement analysis helps ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the software's functionality and business goals. Without clear requirements, misunderstandings can lead to significant delays, wasted resources, and misaligned features.
  
2. **Reduces Costs and Risks**: Identifying requirements early in the project allows for better pl
